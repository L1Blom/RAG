# RAG Service

RAG Service is a template service for a retrieval-augmented generator based on the examples of LangChain. See: [Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/rag/)

## Technologies

[![Used in this project](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=vscode,py,flask,ai,md,linux,bash,nginx,pylint,git,raspberrypi&theme=light)](https://skillicons.dev)


## Installation

1. Clone https://github.com/L1Blom/rag to your project directory
2. Move config.py_example to config.py and add your API Key
3. Choose an ID for your instance, like MyDocs
4. Copy constants/constants.py to constants_MyDocs.py
5. Change the contents of this file to reflect your situation
6. Create a data/ directory and create a MyDocs/ directory in it
7. Add the files for your RAG context, like text-files
8. Create a Python virtual environment for your project (optional)
9. Modify the example services/rag.service_template file to point to the right place of your project directory
10. Copy the services file to /etc/systed/system/rag_MyDocs.service
11. Enable and start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable rag_MyDocs
sudo systemctl start rag_MyDocs
sudo systemctl status rag_MyDocs
```

## Commands

All calls support POST and GET. For \<ID\> use your chosen ID like MyDocs

1. /prompt/\<ID\>/
    Parameter: prompt (string)
    Your prompt to be send to openAI

2. /prompt/\<ID\>/model
    Parameter: model (string)
    Your model to be used, like "gpt-4o"
    Checking on valid models with OpenAI client.models.list(). Can result in http 500 error (non-fatal)

3. /prompt/\<ID\>/temp
    Parameter: temp (string, will be cast to float)
    Temperature setting, between 0.0 and 2.0
    Settings above 1.0 can give significant halicunations and degrades performance too.
    Timeout can result in http 408 error (non-fatal)

4. /prompt/\<ID\>/reload
    Parameters: none
    After adding files to your data directory, use this to reload the vector store

5. /prompt/\<ID\>/clear
    Paramters: none
    Clears the cache, the in-memory history

6. /prompt/\<ID\>/cache
    Paramaters: none
    Prints the cache contents to the response object

7. /prompt/\<ID\>/image
    Parameters: prompt (string), image (URL to image)
    Uploads the image to openAI and use prompt to get the desired contents like: 'What is the mood of the persons?'
    Note: only works if model is set to 'gpt-4o'. Other models result in http 500 error (non-fatal)

## Usage

```bash
# change the model
curl -X POST --data-urlencode "model=gpt-4o" http://<your server>:<your port>/prompt/<ID>/model
Model set to: gpt-4o(your virtual env) 
# prompt to your data
curl -X POST --data-urlencode "prompt=your question?" http://<your server>:<your port>/prompt/<ID>
Your answer based on the context files provided in data/<ID>
```

## Constants file

```python
# simple string like "mydata"
ID="<your identifier" 
# any unused port, will run the Flask server
PORT=9100
# Set to True if you want to enable Flask debug
DEBUG=False
# Any other level will make it less verbose
LOGGING_LEVEL="INFO"
# Directory that will be scanned for files to be added to the context
DATA_DIR="/home/data"
# All the file extentions you want to be part of the context, see LangChain documentation
DATA_GLOB="*.txt" 
# The lower, the more precise. Needs to be between 0.0 and 2.0
TEMPERATURE=0.0 
# Influences the way answers are produced
contextualize_q_system_prompt = (
        "Given a chat history and the latest user question "
        "which might reference context in the chat history, "
        "formulate a standalone question which can be understood "
    )
# Influences the way answers are produced
system_prompt = ( # choose your language, English works best
        "You are a chatbot and gives answer in not more than 3 sentences"
    )
chunk_size=1000    # depending on your data, seel LangChain documentation
chunk_overlap=100  # idem
```

## TODO's and wishes
- Unit tests
- More file formats like PDF
- Saving the vectorstore
- Upload files
- Other API's than OpenAI and other LLM's
- A simple frontend from the GitHub community
